# Quantum_comp_mini_project

## Introduction
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic optimization problem where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city once and returns to the starting city. This project solves the TSP using an optimization algorithm and visualizes the optimal path, showing the cities and the distances between them.

## Installation
To run the project, you will need Python and the following packages:

* networkx (for graph creation and visualization)
* matplotlib (for plotting the graph)
* numpy (for matrix manipulation)

## Visualization
The graph displays:

* Cities: Represented as nodes in the graph.
* Optimal Path: Represented by directed edges between cities.
* Distances: Displayed on each edge, indicating the distance between connected cities.
